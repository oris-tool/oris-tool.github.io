  <h4>Getting Oris up and running</h4>
  <p>First of all, let's learn how to get Oris up and running.</p>
  <p>Once you have Oris downloaded from the link in the home, head to the download folder and unzip the Oris archive you just downloaded.</p>
  <p>Then, you can open the folder created and run Oris by simply running either <i>run.bat</i>, if you are on Windows, or <i>run.sh</i>, if you are on Linux or Mac.</p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    <strong>Remember!</strong> Be sure to have the correct Java version installed, or Oris won't run.

  <h4>Simple network creation</h4>
  <p>Now that we have Oris working and running we can start learning how to create our very first Petri Net with Oris following a simple example. The example Petri Net we're going to build will model a simple transmission with timeout on a lossy channel.</p>
  <p>The very first step is to create a new empty net by clicking the button <img class="toolbar-btn" src="/images/new_btn.png"> from the toolbar. Alternatively, you can click <i>File</i> â†’ <i>New</i>, from the menu, or use the shortcut <i>Ctrl+N</i>.</p>
  <p>Let's start by adding a new place: to add a new place just click on the <img class="toolbar-btn" src="/images/place_btn.png"> button and then on a random position on the canvas. You can see a new place will spawn, as shown below:</p>
  <p><img class="tutorial-screenshot" src="/images/first_place.png"></p>
  <p>If we now double click on the place we just created, we can specify its name and the number of tokens in that place in the initial marking. Let's call it <i>ready</i> and give it one token, as shown below:</p>
  <p><img class="tutorial-screenshot" src="/images/rename_place.png"></p>
  <p>Now let's click <i>OK</i> to make the changes permanent.</p>
  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <strong>Protip:</strong> If you select the <img class="toolbar-btn" src="/images/select_btn.png"> button, you can drag the place's name for a better readability.
  </div>
  <p>With the same method we've just seen, let's add four more places: <i>sent</i>, <i>received</i> and <i>timedOut</i>, with zero tokens, and <i>sending</i>, with one. For more clarity, the relative position of the places should be as shown below:</p>
  <p><img class="tutorial-screenshot" src="/images/all_places_added.png"></p>
  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <strong>Protip 2:</strong> When you drag an element, Oris will show some helpful alignment lines.
  </div>
  <p>Now that we have all the places we need set, let's add some transition.</p>
  <p>The first transition we're gonna add will be a uniformely distributed transition (also called <i>UNI</i>): to create our new UNI transition let's select the <img class="toolbar-btn" src="/images/uni_btn.png"> button and click between the places <i>ready</i> and <i>sent</i>. Then, let's double click on the newly created transition to customize it's parameters as follows:</p>
  <p><img class="tutorial-screenshot" src="/images/uni_transition.png"></p>
  <p>With these parameters we're basically telling the <i>send</i> transition to have a uniform probability distribution between 1 and 2 and to be able to fire only if the place <i>timedOut</i> has no marking (i.e. we want to send a message only if we've not yet timed out). Finally, selecting the <img class="toolbar-btn" src="/images/arc_btn.png">, we can create an arc between a place and a transition (or viceversa) by dragging the arc from the starting element to the destination element: in this case let's create an arc from <i>ready</i> to <i>send</i> and another one from <i>send</i> to <i>sent</i>.</p>
  <p>The result should be as follows:</p>
  <p><img class="tutorial-screenshot" src="/images/send_added.png"></p>
  <p>Let's add three more transitions now.</p>
  <p>The first will be a deterministiclally distributed transition (also called DET, added with the <img class="toolbar-btn" src="/images/det_btn.png"> button). Let's call this one <i>timeout</i> and give it a value (<i>Stochastic properties</i> tab) of 5. This transition should be place between <i>sending</i> and <i>timedOut</i>, with an arc from <i>sending</i> to <i>timeout</i> and another one from <i>timeout</i> to <i>timedOut</i>.</p>
  <p>Then, we want to add an immediate transition (a.k.a. IMM, <img class="toolbar-btn" src="/images/imm_btn.png"> button) just above the <i>send</i> transition. We'll call this one <i>lost</i> and will have an incoming arc from <i>sent</i> and an outgoing one towards <i>ready</i>.</p>
  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <strong>Protip 3:</strong> If you double-click on an arc, you can create joint nodes, for a better organization.
  </div>
  <p>Finally, we need a last IMM transition, between <i>sent</i> and <i>received</i>. This last transition, to be called <i>success</i>, should have two incoming arcs, one from <i>sent</i> and one from <i>sending</i>, and an outgoing one, towards <i>received</i>.</p>
  <p>If done properly, the final result should be as follows:</p>
  <p><img class="tutorial-screenshot" src="/images/timeout_final.png"></p>
  <p>The Petri Net is now completed and is ready to be used for various analysis.</p>
  <p>Remember to save the Petri Net before closing, by clicking the <img class="toolbar-btn" src="/images/save_btn.png"> button, if you want to reuse the net later. This process will generate a file in XPN format that contains the Petri Net description.</p>

  <h4>Regenerative transient analysis</h4>
  <p>One of the most useful analysis that can be conducted on a Petri Net is the <i>regenerative transient analysis</i>.</p>
  <p>The transient analysis is the analysis of the probabilities of being in a certain state at a certain moment in time, given that the process started from another given state. This analysis generates a three dimensional matrix, with time as the first dimension, the possible starting states as second dimension and the possible arrival states as third dimension.</p>
  <p>Regenerative transient analysis indicates the transient analysis done on a generic Markov Regenerative Process (MPR). An MRP is a sthocastic process that, sooner or later, will certainly reach a regeneration (i.e. a moment in time where the past history of the process adds no information to the future probabilities).</p>
  <p>In this section we'll analyze the "Trasmission with Timeout" model we build in the previous section. If you don't have the model open in Oris (or you didn't save it) you can download it from the examples and open it again.</p>
  <p>Once we have the model back up on the main pane, we can start a new regenerative transient analysis by clicking the <img class="toolbar-btn" src="/images/reg_trans_btn.png"> button. We'll notice a new panel, like the one below, with several parameter fields:</p>
  <p><img class="tutorial-screenshot" src="/images/reg_trans_params.png"></p>
  <p>Let's explain briefly the main parameters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Time limit</b>: represent the temporal upper bound of the transient analysis, meaning that the analysis will run until the time limit specified is reached (or when a stop condition has occurred, if specified);</li>
    <li><b>Allowed error</b>: specifies the maximum error we allow the results to have: higher allowed errors means faster analysis, but also more inaccurate results;</li>
    <li><b>Discretization step</b>: since the analysis cannot be done in a continuous way, it have to be done on certain points of time: how close to each other these points will be is decided by the discretization step, where a smaller step means that more points will be calculated, which involves longer analysis time but more accurate result;</li>
    <li><b>Extended regenerations</b>: if checked</li>
  </ul>
