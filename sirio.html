  <h1>The Sirio Library</h1>
  <p>
    <code>Sirio</code> is an open-source library of reusable
    components for the analysis of TPN and STPN models.  It provides
    the analysis functions of ORIS through a flexible Java API and
    allows the user to conduct parametric studies, by building and
    analyzing a model for a multitude of parameters, such as different
    PDFs of timed events (e.g., times to failure, times to repair) or
    different discrete distributions of immediate choices (e.g.,
    probability of message losses).

      To include Sirio in your Java project, check the instructions on
      its <a href="https://github.com/oris-tool/sirio">GitHub
      repository</a>.

      To quickly get started with Sirio, you can import a
      <a href="https://github.com/oris-tool/sirio-examples">ready-to-use Maven project</a>
      into your Eclipse workspace. The project includes Sirio as a
      dependency and provides an example of how to create an STPN and
      compute its transient probabilities.
